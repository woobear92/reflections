How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

   
 By viewing a diff between two versions of a file, it helps me to see what was added and what was deleted.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

  
 You can go back to the history of previous files and compare one another to see what was added and deleted. 
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   
 By manually choosing to create a commit, you are in control of process. 
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

 
 Because depending on which or different types of project you are working, it is easier to save multiple files in one commit and treat each file separately. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

 

 git log allows you to see recent committs(most recent commit being very top) and git diff allows you to compare the different committs.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

 
 Even if you make mistakes or make changes that could break something, you can always go back to the previous process and see what went wrong.
 
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
